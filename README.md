This project was aimed to dabble in the realm of Python's ML and data visualization libaries such as SKLearn's SVM classifier, Scipy and Pandas data wrangling, and Matplotlib's data visualization capabilities.

It contains two parts:
# Part One: 
### The goal of this section is to perform different data analyses on RNAseq gene expression data collected from 500 (COAD) Colon adenocarcinoma tumors (one of prevalent types of cancer) from TCGA data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/docs/publications/tcga/) 

# Part Two:
### Here I classify the mRNA data pertaining two different subtypes of breast cancer. The zip data file contains the measured expression of 200 genes across 500 patients diagnosed with subtype 1 (250 patients) and subtype 2 (250 patients) breast cancer.
